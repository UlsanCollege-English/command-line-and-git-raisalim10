hello! 
It's me Salim Rai. I am from Nepal. During my High School, I chose Computer Science as my major.
And currently I am studying IT at Ulsan College (울산과학대학교).
I chose this IT course as degree are the measure of angle and I was yet to find the angle of direction in my life.
I thought IT will give some angle to my non-directional life.
